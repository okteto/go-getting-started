This repository contains the code for a Golang getting started sample for Okteto. It has a Golang backend
(in the `main.go` file) without a frontend.

## General Setup

The repository is configured with Okteto.
These are the full documentation of the [Okteto Manifest](https://www.okteto.com/docs/reference/okteto-manifest/) and [Okteto CLI](https://www.okteto.com/docs/reference/okteto-cli/).


The `okteto.yml` file defines how to build, deploy and test the application:

- Build: run `okteto build`. The `okteto.yml` file has a section to define images to build.
- Deploy: run `okteto deploy`. The `okteto.yml` file has a section with the deploy scripts. In this case, it calls kubectl with the file k8s.yml
- Test: run `okteto test`.

For every change, make sure `okteto build` and `okteto deploy` works and the application behaves as expected in the endpoints generated by Okteto. You can get these endpoints calling `okteto endpoints`.

If you need to install dependencies, add them to the Dockerfile and run `okteto build` again.

If you need to troubleshoot the application, run `okteto kubeconfig`. Then, you can access the logs of each pod with `kubectl logs`.
You must always run `kubectl` commands with the `-n ${OKTETO_NAMESPACE}` argument, to make sure they are scoped to your namespace.

If you need to modify the deployment of the application, do it with `okteto deploy` and modifying the `deploy` section of the okteto.yml file. You can only execute `kubectl` to retrieve logs and manifest. If you need to run any other
